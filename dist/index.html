    <div class="content">
      <p>Using the <i>PIMA Indian Diabetes DataSet</i> from Kaggle I created a cutting edge machine learning algorithm that takes into account some simple variables to check if there is a significant risk for diabetes. <br><br> Measured the model on an independent sample the model was able to identify 70% of the total diabetic cases and was accurate in that prediction in more than 55% of the cases.<br><br>
      <b>Warnings: the app cannot replace any medical visit or control and you shall not conider it as a professional medical advice. It only may give you and indication for a check-up if you did not plan to do so previously.</b><br><br> The underlaying model was trained using a sample mainly from PIMA Indians. Thereby maybe the model works more accurately in the case of that specific group.</p>
